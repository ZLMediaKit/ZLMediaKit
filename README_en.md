- CMake 3.1+.
- Linux (32-bit and 64-bit).
- Apple macOS (32-bit and 64-bit).
- Any hardware with x86, x86_64, ARM, or MIPS CPU.

## How to build

It is recommended to compile on Ubuntu or macOS. Compiling on Windows is cumbersome, and some features are not compiled by default.

### Before Building

- **You must use Git to clone the complete code. Do not download the source code by downloading the ZIP package. Otherwise, the submodule code will not be downloaded by default. You can do it like this:**
```
git clone https://github.com/ZLMediaKit/ZLMediaKit.git
cd ZLMediaKit
git submodule update --init
```

### Building on Linux

- My Environment
  - Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit) with GCC 5.4.
  - CMake 3.5.1.
- Guidance
  
  ```
	# If it is on CentOS 6.x, you need to install a newer version of GCC and CMake first,
	# and then compile manually according to the "build_for_linux.sh" script.
	# If it is on a newer version of a system such as Ubuntu or Debian,
	# step 4 can be manipulated directly.
	
	# 1. Install GCC 5.2 (this step can be skipped if the GCC version is higher than 4.7).
	sudo yum install centos-release-scl -y
	sudo yum install devtoolset-4-toolchain -y
	scl enable devtoolset-4 bash
	
	# 2. Install CMake (this step can be skipped if the CMake version is higher than 3.1).
	tar -xvf cmake-3.10.0-rc4.tar.gz #you need to download the CMake source file manually
	cd cmake-3.10.0-rc4
	./configure
	make -j4
	sudo make install
	
	# 3. Switch to a higher version of GCC.
	scl enable devtoolset-4 bash
	
	# 4. Build.
	cd ZLMediaKit
	./build_for_linux.sh
  ```

### Building on macOS

- My Environment
  - macOS Sierra (10.12.1) with Xcode 8.3.1.
  - Homebrew 1.1.3.
  - CMake 3.8.0.
- Guidance
  
  ```
  cd ZLMediaKit
  ./build_for_mac.sh
  ```

### Building on iOS
- You can generate Xcode projects and recompile them , [learn more](https://github.com/leetal/ios-cmake):

  ```
  cd ZLMediaKit
  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  # Generate Xcode project, project file is in build directory
  cmake .. -G Xcode -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/ios.toolchain.cmake  -DPLATFORM=OS64COMBINED
  ```
  

### Building on Android

  Now you can open the Android Studio project in the `Android` folder. This is an `AAR` library and demo project.

- My environment
  - macOS Sierra (10.12.1) + Xcode 8.3.1
  - Homebrew 1.1.3
  - CMake 3.8.0
  - [Android NDK r14b](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r14b-darwin-x86_64.zip)
  
- Guidance 

  ```
  cd ZLMediaKit
  export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=/path/to/ndk
  ./build_for_android.sh
  ```
  
### Building on Windows

- My environment
  - Windows 10
  - Visual Studio 2017
  - [CMake GUI](https://cmake.org/files/v3.10/cmake-3.10.0-rc1-win32-x86.msi)
  
- Guidance
```
1. Enter the ZLMediaKit directory and execute `git submodule update --init` to download the code for ZLToolKit.
2. Open the project with CMake GUI and generate the Visual Studio project file.
3. Find the project file (ZLMediaKit.sln), double-click to open it with VS2017.
4. Choose to compile the Release version. Find the target file and run the test cases.
```

    weak_ptr<MediaPlayer> weakPlayer = player;
    player->setOnPlayResult([weakPlayer](const SockException &ex) {
        InfoL << "OnPlayResult:" << ex.what();
        auto strongPlayer = weakPlayer.lock();
        if (ex || !strongPlayer) {
            return;
        }

        auto videoTrack = strongPlayer->getTrack(TrackVideo);
        if (!videoTrack) {
            WarnL << "No video Track!";
            return;
        }
        videoTrack->addDelegate([](const Frame::Ptr &frame) {
            //please decode video here
        });
    });

    player->setOnShutdown([](const SockException &ex) {
        ErrorL << "OnShutdown:" << ex.what();
    });

    //RTP transport over TCP
    (*player)[Client::kRtpType] = Rtsp::RTP_TCP;
    player->play("rtsp://admin:jzan123456@192.168.0.122/");
	```
- As a proxy server：
	```cpp
	//Support RTMP and RTSP URLs, but only H264 + AAC codec is supported
	auto urlList = {"rtmp://live.hkstv.hk.lxdns.com/live/hks",
			"rtsp://184.72.239.149/vod/mp4://BigBuckBunny_175k.mov"};
	map<string , PlayerProxy::Ptr> proxyMap;
	int i=0;
	for(auto url : urlList){
		PlayerProxy::Ptr player(new PlayerProxy("live",to_string(i++).data()));
		player->play(url);
		proxyMap.emplace(string(url),player);
	}
	```
	
- As a pusher：
	```cpp
	PlayerProxy::Ptr player(new PlayerProxy("app","stream"));
	player->play("rtmp://live.hkstv.hk.lxdns.com/live/hks");
	
	RtmpPusher::Ptr pusher;
	NoticeCenter::Instance().addListener(nullptr,Config::Broadcast::kBroadcastRtmpSrcRegisted,
			[&pusher](BroadcastRtmpSrcRegistedArgs){
		const_cast<RtmpPusher::Ptr &>(pusher).reset(new RtmpPusher(app,stream));
		pusher->publish("rtmp://jizan.iok.la/live/test");
	});
	
	```

## Special Thanks

This project uses the [media-server](https://github.com/ireader/media-server) library developed by [Lao Chen](https://github.com/ireader). The reuse and de-multiplexing of ts/fmp4/mp4/ps container formats in this project depend on the media-server library. Lao Chen has provided invaluable help and support multiple times in implementing many functions of this project, and we would like to express our sincere gratitude to him!
